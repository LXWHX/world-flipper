# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single-page fan site ("World Flipper Museum & Archive") for browsing the mobile game World Flipper's
characters, art, story, and music. There is no build step, no bundler, and no test suite — it's static
HTML/JS served as-is (works directly via `file://` for local dev).

## Wiki data pipeline (bilibili biligame Chinese wiki)

`Character Assets/rarityN/<devName>/wiki_zh.json` (+ sibling `voice/*.mp3`) holds text data
(basic info, skills, story, evaluation, voice lines) scraped from `wiki.biligame.com`. Dev-only,
three-step pipeline: `npm run scrape:wiki-zh` (`scripts/scrape-wiki-zh.mjs` + shared parsing in
`scripts/lib/wiki-common.mjs`) crawls the wiki into `scripts/.wiki-scrape-cache/` (gitignored,
resumable); `npm run match:wiki-zh` (`scripts/match-wiki-to-roster.mjs`) matches pages to
`roster.json` by `jpName`, downloads voice mp3s, writes `wiki_zh.json`, and stamps
`hasWiki`/`voiceCount`/`zhName` (from the wiki's `basicInfo.chineseName`) on `roster.json`
(unmatched/ambiguous cases go to `Character Assets/_unmatched_wiki_report.md`); `index.html`'s
`goDetail(c)` lazily fetches `wiki_zh.json` per character (not folded into the eager `roster.json`
load) and renders it inline in the character detail sheet, below the Skill/Special GIF-preview
buttons (see "Character detail bottom sheet" below), reusing the music-player pattern for voice
playback. A future English wiki source can follow the same shape, matched by `enName` into a
parallel `wiki_en.json`.

## miaowm5 data pipeline (worldflipper.miaowm5.com)

Second data source, layered on top of the bilibili data. worldflipper.miaowm5.com is an open-source
Svelte SPA (github.com/miaowm5/wf-encyclopedia) that serves all its data as structured JSON from
public CDNs, keyed by the game's internal `devName` — the same key `roster.json` uses, so matching is
exact and needs no fuzzy `jpName` logic. There is **no HTML scraping**: `scripts/fetch-miaowm5.mjs`
fetches the same JSON the site does and decodes it with ports of the site's own parsing logic
(`scripts/lib/miaowm5-common.mjs`). When changing a decoder, check it against the upstream source
rather than reverse-engineering the raw columns.

`npm run fetch:miaowm5` (flags: `--force`, `--limit=N`, `--only=devName,...`, `--new-chars`) is
dev-only and resumable: every HTTP response is disk-cached under `scripts/.miaowm5-cache/` (gitignored) keyed by
URL path, and per-character progress lands in `scripts/.miaowm5-manifest.json`. A cold full run takes
~60 min (it decodes ~180 atlas pages and encodes ~1400 GIFs) and needs ~1.2GB of cache on disk; a
no-op re-run takes seconds, because every step checks for its output file before decoding anything.

**`--new-chars` (roster-producing mode).** The default run iterates `roster.json`; `--new-chars`
iterates `character.json` instead, so it can bootstrap characters the roster has never heard of —
it creates `rarityN/<devName>/`, runs the same per-character steps, and appends a roster entry
(`rarity` = `character.json` row[2], `attribute` = row[3] via `Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light/Dark`).
It only adds a character that has **both** a pixel timeline (its `neutral.gif` thumbnail) and
`story_character` art (its bust), and skips the `700xxx` `gameId` block outright: those are
engine-internal entries (assist stubs, `_no_piercing` mechanic variants, `_chapter12` boss forms),
and no real roster character lives there. That filter yields 108 characters; the roster is now 485.
The mode is naturally idempotent — once a character is in the roster, it's no longer "new".

**`bustOnly` characters.** miaowm5 has **no** 1440x1920 full illustration — only the 570x690 story
bust (it's what miaowm5's own site displays), and the `full_shot_*` files came from a separate
source that has nothing for these 108. So their roster entries carry `bustOnly: true` and the detail
page uses the stacked bust as hero art with the awaken toggle hidden (see "Character detail bottom
sheet"). They also carry **no `enName`/`jpName`** — miaowm5 is a Chinese source — only `zhName` from
`character_text[gameId][0]`, so the front-end falls back `enName || zhName || devName`. Three
Black Clover collab characters (`asta`, `yuno`, `noelle_silva`) have Japanese-script `zhName`s
because the game's own CN data left them untranslated.

Note that adding roster entries makes previously-unresolvable `related` chips on **existing**
characters resolve, so a default run after `--new-chars` legitimately rewrites their `wiki_zh.json`
(163 files / 362 chips, the last time this happened). That's a real content change, not the
gratuitous timestamp churn the byte-stability rules below exist to prevent — don't suppress it.

**Three ID spaces — the main trap.** `devName` is the roster/folder key (and the key for
`character.json`/`pixel.json`); `gameId` keys `character_text`/`character_quest` and is what
`encyclopedia[5]` points at; `storyId` (= `character.json`'s `[8]`) keys `story_character` and the
pixel atlases. `storyId` usually equals `devName`, but not always — never assume. (`head.png` is
the one piece of art keyed by `devName` rather than `storyId` — that's upstream's own choice, not
an inconsistency to "fix".)

**Owned-keys contract.** The pipeline owns exactly `info`, `related`, `emotions`, `pixelActions`,
`storyCount`, `miaowm5Meta` and `voice[].textJp` inside `wiki_zh.json`, and never touches the
bilibili-owned keys. It merges into the existing file (creating a minimal skeleton with empty
bilibili fields for the ~6 roster characters the bilibili pipeline never matched, so the front-end
needs no special-casing), and deletes any key whose value comes out empty. All writes go through
`writeIfChanged`/`writeJsonIfChanged`, so a re-run is byte-stable and produces zero diff — keep it
that way. That's also why `story_zh.json`'s `generatedAt` is preserved unless the payload actually
changes, and why nothing carries a per-run `fetchedAt`: a fresh timestamp every run would rewrite
~370 files and force a full R2 re-upload.

What it produces per character, beyond the `wiki_zh.json` keys:
- `story_zh.json` — full dialogue for every character episode (speaker, name-plate colour, emotion,
  text). Much bigger than the other files, so `index.html` only fetches it when the story panel is
  opened (`loadStory()`), not in `goDetail()`.
- `emotion/*.png` — expression art as two 570x690 layers (`base_N.png` body + `<i>_<name>.png` face)
  that the front-end stacks, rather than one flattened composite per expression.
- `head.png` — the 212x212 framed square portrait miaowm5's own character list shows, used by both
  the Units grid tile and the detail sheet's related-character chips. It's a port of upstream's
  `headIcon.svelte` canvas
  composite and keeps its exact offsets: the portrait (the `head` atlas on `CDN_B`, keyed by
  `devName`) is smooth-scaled to 184x184 and inset at (14,14) so `res/icon`'s
  `character_face_frame` rings it in white, then the element badge is scaled 61->48 and dropped at
  (154,10), landing in the notch the frame leaves open. The portrait carries its own background,
  so unlike the emotion layers the frame and badge are the only overlays. Two things to know:
  - The element index is `character.json` row[3], mapped `0..5 -> red/blue/yellow/green/white/black`
    — i.e. the same order as `ATTRIBUTES` (Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light/Dark), verified to agree
    with every roster entry's `attribute`. A character with no element gets
    `character_face_empty_frame`, whose corner isn't notched.
  - Upstream also stamps the rarity strip at (0,177). **We deliberately skip it**, because the
    Units grid renders that strip on the pedestal instead, where it's actually legible.
  All 485 roster characters have a head sprite, but a partial run (`--only`/`--limit`) wouldn't, so
  the roster carries `hasHead` and callers fall back to the pixel `neutral.gif` rather than trusting
  the path to resolve. Note `head.png`'s fast path skips when the file exists, so **changing the
  composite means deleting the old files** — don't reach for `--force`, which would also regenerate
  every pixel GIF (see above).
- missing pixel `*.gif` — the site already ships 5 actions + `special`; miaowm5's pixel timeline
  usually also has `into_coffin`/`ghost_raise`/`ghost_neutral`/`revive` (and a few characters have
  many more). **`special` is a special case**: its frames live in a *second* atlas
  (`pixel_special`, same `storyId` key) and `pixel.json`'s timeline never references them — no
  entry is `>= 10000`. Upstream synthesizes that entry (`loadPixel.svelte.js` pushes
  `{name:'special', begin:10000, end:<last special frame id>}`) and merges both frame lists into
  one `imageList`, using the 10000 offset to keep the two id spaces apart; `buildPixelGifs` mirrors
  that. Characters below 4★ have no special frames at all, which is why ~92 of them legitimately
  have no `special.gif` and no Special button — that's the game's data, not a gap.
  `pixelActions` lists what the folder actually holds, so the UI never links a missing
  file. Existing GIFs are left alone: they were exported from an older revision of the upstream
  pixel data, so regenerating them would change timings for no benefit.

It also stamps **`race`** (an array — a character can be `["Human","Beast"]`) and **`gender`** on each
roster entry, straight from the `character.json` row (`[4]` and `[7]`). Both exist only to drive the
Units filter. `gender`'s raw values include `Unknown` and a one-off `Ririi` alongside `Male`/`Female`;
the roster keeps them raw and the front-end folds anything that isn't Male/Female into `Other`, which
is what upstream's own filter does. Three roster entries (`anger_investigator`, `estateguild_leader`,
`scissor_ratgirl`) have `thumb: null` and so are skipped by every pipeline mode and filtered out of
the grid — they legitimately carry neither field.

It also writes **`icons/*.png`** — the one thing it produces outside `Character Assets/`.
These are the game's own rarity stars (`res/icon`'s `rarity_{one..five}`), laid on each pedestal by
the Units grid and shown beside the name in the detail sheet — the site draws no star glyphs of its
own any more. They're shared UI chrome rather than per-character art, so they live in the repo's
`icons/` folder next to `small-*.png` — served with the site, committed to git, and **never touched
by the R2 pipeline** (don't call `invalidateR2` on them; that helper resolves paths relative to
`Character Assets/`). Upstream pairs the stars with a dark angled plate (`rarity_background{N}`);
we deliberately export the stars alone, since on the pedestal they sit on the attribute colour and
the plate only muddied it. Each rarity's art is a fixed 27px tall but widens with the star count
(29px at 1★ up to 128px at 5★), which is why the front-end sizes them by height and lets width
follow — that keeps a star the same size at every rarity. The 5★ stars carry cyan accents and the
lower tiers don't; that's the game's art, not a bug.

`buildFilterIcons` writes the rest of the `icons/` set, on the same terms (shared chrome, in git,
never uploaded to R2) and with the same "skip if the file exists" fast path — **so changing one of
these composites means deleting the old file first**:
- `element_{0..5}.png` / `race_<Race>.png` — the badges the Units filter puts on its chips. They're
  named by the *data* value (row[3]'s index, row[4]'s token), not by upstream's sprite name, so the
  front-end builds a path straight from a roster field with no second lookup table. `element_*` is
  the same `element_*_medium` art `buildHeadIcon` stamps on the portrait; the race chips use the
  sheet's `_medium2` variants, which is what upstream's filter uses.
- `title_border_{left,right}.png` — the flourish upstream's `<Title>` trails either side of a
  section heading. Upstream's sprite names are `wf_ui_flipper_border_left` and (for the right one)
  plain `wf_ui_flipper_border`; we save them as left/right to spare the next reader that trap.
- `circle.png` — the magic circle turning behind the page (see "Page background" below). Written by
  `buildMagicCircle`, not `buildFilterIcons`: it's the one asset here that isn't in an atlas — it's
  a standalone file on `CDN_A` (`ui/circle.png`), so it's copied through byte-for-byte with no
  decoding.

Because any rewritten file must be re-uploaded, the script drops that file's key from
`scripts/.r2-upload-manifest.json` (which `upload-to-r2.mjs` uses to skip already-uploaded paths)
instead of teaching that script about content hashes. `Character Assets/_miaowm5_report.md` lists
roster characters absent from miaowm5's data.

## Commands

- `npm run upload:assets` — uploads `Character Assets/` to the Cloudflare R2 bucket (`wf-assets`) via
  `scripts/upload-to-r2.mjs`. Requires `npx wrangler login` once (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` /
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` env vars). Only ships `roster.json` and `rarityN/` folders — dev-only files
  (`*.ps1`, `*_log.txt`, `metadata.json`, `_unmatched_music/`, reports) are intentionally excluded, see
  `INCLUDE_TOP_LEVEL`/`INCLUDE_DIR_PREFIX` in that script. Uploads resume via
  `scripts/.r2-upload-manifest.json`; pass `--force` to re-upload everything.
- No lint/test/build commands exist. To sanity-check a change, open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Architecture

### The `x-dc` template + `DCLogic` component pattern

`index.html` is not plain HTML — it's authored for a small proprietary runtime ("omelette"/`dc-runtime`),
whose compiled output is `support.js` (see its header: **generated from `dc-runtime/src/*.ts`, do not hand-edit**
— the source project isn't part of this repo). The pattern:

- Everything inside `<x-dc>...</x-dc>` is the view template. It's plain HTML/SVG with a small binding
  syntax layered on top:
  - `{{ expr }}` interpolates a value from the component's render output (e.g. `background: {{ tabBgUnits }}`).
  - `<sc-if value="{{ isHome }}" hint-placeholder-val="{{ true }}">` is conditional rendering; the
    `hint-placeholder-val` is only an editor/preview hint, not runtime logic.
  - `onClick="{{ handlerName }}"`, `style-hover="..."`, `style-active="..."` bind events/pseudostates.
- The `<script type="text/x-dc" data-dc-script data-props="{...}">` block at the bottom of `index.html`
  is real JS: a single `class Component extends DCLogic` with `state`, lifecycle methods
  (`componentDidMount`), event handlers, and a `renderVals()` method that returns the flat object of
  everything the template's `{{ }}` bindings reference. **All view logic lives in `renderVals()`** — if
  you need a new template binding, add it to the object this method returns.
  - `data-props` (HTML-entity-encoded JSON) declares the component's editable props (`accent`,
    `showCounters`, etc.) with editor metadata (`editor`, `default`, `options`, `section`) — this is
    metadata for whatever design tool authored this file, and also defines `this.props` defaults.
- `image-slot.js` defines a `<image-slot>` web component for drag-and-drop image placeholders in that
  same design-tool environment; it's read-only/inert outside that tool (see the file's header doc
  comment) and isn't part of this site's actual runtime behavior — currently only referenced for its
  script tag, not used in the visible UI.

**Do not hand-edit `support.js`** — regenerate it from the `dc-runtime` project if it ever needs to change.
Treat `image-slot.js` similarly (scaffold file, not meant for feature edits).

### Backgrounds: the magic circle

The site's backdrop is a port of miaowm5's `ui/magicCircle.svelte` — their `icons/circle.png`
turning on a 25s linear loop over flat `#EAEAEA`. It replaced **every** blue surface the site used
to have (the card's gradient, the detail screen's radial) and every transparency checkerboard
(`repeating-conic-gradient`) the character art used to sit on, so those patterns should not come
back. The page outside the card is plain `#EAEAEA`; the card is the same grey, separated only by
its (now neutral, once blue-tinted) shadow.

The CSS lives in the `<helmet>` block as `.wf-circle` plus upstream's `dialog` variant
(`.wf-circle-dialog` — smaller, 60% opacity, pushed further down). Five hosts carry one: the card's
**screen area** (the app's backdrop), the **detail drawer**, the **filter dialog**, and each of the
two per-character art stages (the platform GIF stage and the expression viewer).

Four things to respect if you touch this:

- **`z-index: -1` on `.wf-circle` is load-bearing** and is upstream's own value. It puts the circle
  above its host's background but behind the host's ordinary in-flow content — the only way the
  drawer's text stays on top of it. It only works where the host establishes a stacking context, so
  every host carries `position: relative; z-index: 0` (or already had a z-index, like the drawer's
  `9`). Drop that and the circle escapes to the nearest stacking context and vanishes behind the
  host. The host also needs `overflow: hidden` — that's what crops the circle's bottom half.
- **The translate is repeated inside both keyframes.** `transform` carries position and rotation
  together, so animating `rotate()` alone silently drops the centering and flings the circle off to
  the right. It's also why the two variants can't share one keyframe: their resting translate
  differs (50% vs 60%).
- **The backdrop hangs off the screen area, not the card**, so the opaque tab bar can't cover it.
- Where it is and isn't visible is inherent, not a bug: the home screen's island art and the detail
  hero fill their space and hide it; the drawer's own circle only surfaces once the drawer is
  dragged to its expanded snap point, since it sits at the drawer's bottom edge.

### Single component, tab-based navigation

There's one `Component` instance for the whole app. `this.state.tab` (`'home' | 'units' | 'story' | 'music'
| 'arms' | 'art' | 'detail'`) drives which `<sc-if>` block is visible — there's no router. `go(tab)` switches
tabs; `this.sections` holds per-tab label/description/color metadata.

The **Characters (`units`)** tab is the most complex: it fetches `roster.json` once
(`componentDidMount`), paginates it client-side (`ROSTER_BATCH` = 60 per scroll-triggered batch via
`handleRosterScroll`), and `goDetail(c)` navigates to a per-character `detail` view that probes for an
optional `special.gif` asset and drives GIF/PNG art switching, a draggable bottom sheet
(`sheetPointerDown`, snapping between `SHEET_EXPANDED_Y`/`MID`/`COLLAPSED`), and skill/special overlay
toggles.

`componentDidMount` **sorts** the roster on the way in — rarity descending, then attribute in
`ELEMENT_ORDER` (the game's own Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light/Dark, i.e. `character.json` row[3]'s
index), then `devName` to keep the order stable. The file's own order is just the sequence entries
were appended in (the wiki pipeline's, then `--new-chars`'), which means nothing to a reader.

#### Units filter

A port of miaowm5's `dialog/filterCharacter.svelte`, opened by the round `icons/filer.jpg` button at
the list's top-left. Five groups — name text, rarity, element, gender, race — each OR within itself
and AND across groups, with an empty group inert rather than exclusive (upstream's
`if (!filterInfo) return true`), so "nothing picked" means "show everything". Points worth knowing:

- **Two upstream chips are deliberately dropped**: its rarity "Other" (rarity 0) and element
  "Other" (-1) are its NPC buckets, and this site's roster is characters only (every entry is
  rarity 1-5, element 0-5), so both could only ever match nothing.
- **The rarity chips are stars-only** — no "5"/"四" beside the art, since the star count already
  reads as the rarity (upstream does print both). The label survives as the `img`'s `alt`, so it's
  still what a screen reader announces and what a test should select on (note the grid tile's
  rarity art uses a different alt format, `5★`).
- Chips carry `box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`. That looks arbitrary but isn't: upstream's
  chips are `<button>`s and its `reset.css` puts that shadow on every button — it's the only thing
  separating a `#fafafa` chip from the `#fafafa` dialog behind it. Ours are `<div>`s, so the shadow
  has to be explicit or the chips vanish into the surface.
- **Four race labels don't match their data key** — `Element` shows as "Elf", `Devil` as "Demon",
  `Mystery` as "Fairy", `Plants` as "Plant". That's upstream's own i18n, copied verbatim; the
  `FILTER_RACES` values stay the raw `character.json` tokens because that's what `race` holds.
- `state.filter` is what the grid applies; `state.draftFilter` is the dialog's working copy, so
  chips only take effect on OK and Cancel discards them. `cloneFilter()` copies the group arrays
  too — a shallow spread would let the draft mutate the applied filter in place.
- `filteredRoster()` is the single source both `renderVals` and `handleRosterScroll` read, so
  pagination counts matches rather than raw entries. Applying a filter resets `visibleCount`.
- The button's position (a 38px circle at 4,66) is wedged into the only free gap: the banner's
  section icon ends at y=68 and the grid's first tile starts at y=101 with its portrait from x=38.
  Nudging or growing it lands on one or the other.

#### Units grid tile

Each tile mimics the game's party screen, stacking three things in an 82x100 box: the framed
`head.png` portrait on top, then the character's pixel `neutral.gif` standing on a pedestal built
from two CSS shapes — an elliptical top face plus a trapezoid body (`clip-path`) — tinted by
attribute via the `PEDESTAL` table, with `icons/rarity_{N}.png` centred on the body. Two coupled
numbers to respect when editing:

- The sprite is positioned by `bottom` so its feet land on the ellipse's centre line. Resize the
  pedestal and that offset has to move with it, or the character floats above / sinks into it.
- The stars are sized by height, so their *width* follows the rarity (33px at 5★, 8px at 1★). They
  have to stay inside the trapezoid's narrow bottom edge, which is much narrower than the pedestal
  itself — at 52px wide with a `14%/86%` clip, that edge is only ~37px. Widening the stars or
  narrowing the pedestal makes 5★ overhang first.

Row height (116px) is tuned against the scroller's usable height (622px for 5 rows + 4 8px gaps);
there's ~10px of slack, so growing the tile means shrinking something else.

#### Character detail bottom sheet

The sheet (`SHEET_HEIGHT` = 620px) is split into two parts: a fixed, non-scrolling top strip (drag
handle + name/star row) that carries the `onPointerDown="{{ sheetPointerDown }}"` drag behavior, and
a `flex: 1; overflow-y: auto` body below it holding everything else — the platform GIF stage,
Skill/Special preview buttons, theme music pills, and the wiki data sections (profile/skills/
story/evaluation), gated individually by `hasWikiInfoRows` / `hasWikiSkills` / `hasWikiStory` /
`hasWikiReview`. Splitting the drag handle from the scrollable body matters: `touch-action: none`
only applies to the handle strip, so native touch scrolling still works inside the body. Dragging
still snaps between three `sheetY` offsets (`SHEET_EXPANDED_Y` / `MID` / `COLLAPSED`), but at any
snap point the body's own scroll — not the drag gesture — is what reveals content past the visible
height.

**Panel switcher row.** A row of four round icon buttons (`icons/small-{profile,speaker,story-book,
book}.png`) floats above the sheet's top-right corner as a sibling of the sheet `<div>` (not nested
inside it), sharing the sheet's `sheetTransform`/`sheetTransition` so it visually tracks the sheet
while dragging without being part of its flex layout or scroll area. `state.sheetPanel`
(`'profile' | 'voice' | 'story' | 'related'`, via `setSheetPanel()`) toggles which body content
renders — one `sc-if`-gated block per panel:

- **profile** (small-profile) — `showProfilePanel`: the stage, Skill/Special buttons plus the
  `extraActionButtons` pills for miaowm5's extra pixel actions, theme music pills, the expression
  viewer (`hasEmotions`, stacked 570x690 layers with prev/next — see "Emotion layers" below), and
  the wiki text sections
  (gated individually by `hasWikiInfoRows` / `hasWikiSkills` / `hasWikiStory` / `hasWikiReview`).
  The encyclopedia `info` blocks render under the character-story intro, so `hasWikiStory` also
  accounts for them — a character with no bilibili story can still have info.
- **voice** (small-speaker) — `showVoicePanel`: the voice-line list, with each battle line's
  Japanese `textJp` as grey sub-text, and an empty-state fallback (`hasNoVoiceTracks`).
- **story** (small-story-book) — `showStoryPanel`: episode list → full dialogue, with
  `storyIndex` deciding which (`showStoryList` / `showStoryDetail` / `showStoryEmpty`). This is the
  only panel that lazy-fetches (`loadStory()`, once per character, guarded against the user
  navigating away mid-flight).
- **related** (small-book) — `showRelatedPanel`: related-character chips (clicking one calls
  `goDetail` via the `rosterByDev` map; entries with no roster match get a placeholder tile) and
  keyword cards.

Emotion art only renders for the character being viewed and only for expressions the pipeline
exported, so story dialogue from other speakers falls back to a plain name plate.

**Hero art.** The detail screen normally shows `full_shot_1440_1920_{0,1}.png` with the awaken
toggle. `bustOnly` characters have no such file, so `renderVals()` swaps in the 570x690 story bust
(`showBustHero`, the same stacked `base_N.png` + face layers the expression viewer draws, picking
the `normal` face) and hides the toggle (`showArtToggle`), since there's no awakened bust to toggle
to. The bust arrives with the lazy `wiki_zh.json` fetch, so it needs no separate probe — but that
also means the hero paints a beat after the rest of the screen.

#### Emotion layers (faces vs. overlays)

The game composites an expression as a **comma-separated layer stack**: `story_zh.json`'s `emotion`
is e.g. `"normal,sweat"` — the `normal` face, then the `sweat` overlay on top, both over the shared
`base_N.png` body. Roughly 7% of dialogue lines carry an overlay, so anything resolving `emotion` as
a single name silently loses their art; `renderVals()`'s `resolveEmotionStack()` splits on the comma
and draws every front in order (`sd.emotionFronts`).

Overlay sprites are partial art (a blush, a sweat drop, glasses, an earring) with no features of
their own, so `isEmotionOverlay()` splits `emotions[]` into two groups: faces feed the prev/next
cycler, overlays render as the "Add-ons" toggle chips (`state.emotionOverlays`) that stack onto the
current face. **The classification is derived from the game's own data, not from the sprite art** —
every token seen in a trailing position across all `story_zh.json` files is an overlay, and they all
share the roots in `EMOTION_OVERLAY_ROOTS`. Two traps if you touch this:

- Sprite size does *not* identify an overlay. `shame` is a blush for every character, but for many
  it covers as much of the canvas as their face art does, so a coverage heuristic misclassifies it.
- The root rule over-reaches: `tear_b`/`tear_c` are whole faces despite the `tear` root, so
  `EMOTION_FACE_NAMES` pins them back. Check trailing-token usage before adding a root.

Overlays are offered only when they share the current face's `base`, since mirrored art ships each
one twice (`shame` on base_0, `shame_right` on base_1). Toggles are therefore keyed on the
un-mirrored name (`emotionOverlayKey()`) so flipping to the mirrored face keeps the accessory on;
distinct variants (`effect_rose` vs `effect_kirakira`, `shame` vs `shame_joy`) stay separate keys,
and where a root has several variants the chips fall back to raw names to stay distinguishable.

### UI localization (`STRINGS` table)

The site's UI chrome (nav labels, tab bar, buttons, status/error text, section titles) is bilingual
(English/Chinese). All of it is hardcoded in the `<script data-dc-script>` block, not in the template:

- `STRINGS` is a flat `{ key: { en: '...', zh: '...' } }` table defined above the `Component` class.
- `state.lang` (`'en' | 'zh'`) is read from/written to `localStorage` (`wf_lang`) via `loadLang()`/`toggleLang()`.
- `this.t(key)` looks up `STRINGS[key][this.state.lang]` (falls back to `en`). Every template string goes
  through `renderVals()` calling `t()` — **there is no hardcoded user-facing text left in the `<x-dc>` template**,
  so any new UI copy must be added as a `STRINGS` entry + a `renderVals()` binding, not typed directly into markup.
- `this.sections` (per-tab label/desc/color) is a getter, not a static field, so it re-resolves through `t()`
  on every render as the language changes.
- Character-facing *content* mostly stays outside this table — it's per-character data, not UI chrome.
  The one exception so far is the display name: `roster.json` entries with wiki data carry a `zhName`
  (see below), and both the Units grid and the detail screen pick `zhName` over `enName` when
  `state.lang === 'zh'` (falling back to `enName` for the ~9 characters with no wiki match). Any future
  per-language content field (skill/quote text, etc.) should follow the same flat suffix convention
  rather than nesting, to stay consistent with the existing `enName`/`jpName`/`zhName` fields.

### Asset loading: local vs. R2

`ASSET_BASE` in the component script switches based on how the page is served:
- `file://` or `localhost` → reads directly from the local `Character Assets/` folder.
- anything else (real deployment) → reads from the public Cloudflare R2 bucket URL.

This means asset-loading code paths differ between local testing and production — when changing how
character assets are referenced, check both branches. `Character Assets/`, `WF OST/`, and `node_modules/`
are all gitignored (large binary asset trees); only `roster.json` + `rarityN/*` get uploaded to R2, so any
new asset type added under `Character Assets/` needs to be added to `upload-to-r2.mjs`'s include rules
too, or it will silently never reach production.

`Character Assets/roster.json` is the character index driving the Units tab: each entry has `devName`,
`enName`, `jpName`, `rarity`, `attribute`, `thumb`, an optional `music` array (mp3 filenames, only
present for the ~150 characters with matched BGM), `hasHead` (stamped by `fetch-miaowm5.mjs`; the
square `head.png` lives beside `thumb`, so the front-end derives its URL from that path rather than
storing a second one), `race`/`gender` (also from `fetch-miaowm5.mjs`, driving the Units filter —
see above), and — for the ~368 characters matched by the wiki
pipeline — `zhName`/`hasWiki`/`voiceCount` stamped by `scripts/match-wiki-to-roster.mjs`. The 108
entries added by `fetch-miaowm5.mjs --new-chars` instead carry `bustOnly: true` with no
`enName`/`jpName` and no full-shot art (see the miaowm5 section above). Per-character
folders (`rarityN/<devName>/`) hold the
actual art/GIFs (`neutral.gif`, `head.png`, `full_shot_1440_1920_{0,1}.png`, `walk_front.gif`, `kachidoki.gif`,
`walk_back.gif`, optional `special.gif`, `skill_ready.gif`, plus any extra pixel actions generated by
the miaowm5 pipeline such as `into_coffin.gif`/`ghost_raise.gif`/`ghost_neutral.gif`/`revive.gif`),
an optional `music/` subfolder holding those mp3s, and — from the two data pipelines —
`wiki_zh.json`, `voice/*.mp3`, `story_zh.json` and `emotion/*.png`. The detail view plays music via a
persistent `this.audio = new Audio()` instance
(`toggleMusicTrack`/`stopMusic` in the component script), rendered as pill buttons next to Skill/Special
when `music.length > 0`.
