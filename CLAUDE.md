# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## What this is

A single-page fan site ("World Flipper Museum & Archive") for browsing the mobile game World
Flipper's characters, art, story, and music. No build step, no bundler, no tests — static HTML/JS
served as-is (works via `file://` for local dev). To sanity-check a change, open `index.html` in a
browser.

## Data pipelines (dev-only scripts)

Two sources feed `Character Assets/`: the bilibili wiki (text) and miaowm5 (art + extra data).
Rules that apply across both:

- **Byte-stability.** All writes go through `writeIfChanged`/`writeJsonIfChanged`; a no-op re-run
  produces zero diff. Nothing carries a per-run timestamp (`story_zh.json`'s `generatedAt` is
  preserved unless the payload changes) — a fresh timestamp would rewrite ~370 files and force a
  full R2 re-upload. Keep it that way. (A default run after `--new-chars` legitimately rewriting
  `related` chips in existing `wiki_zh.json` files is a real content change, not churn — don't
  suppress it.)
- **Skip-if-exists fast paths.** Composited images (`head.png`, `story_heads/`, `icons/`) are
  skipped when the output file exists — **changing a composite means deleting the old files
  first**. Don't reach for `--force`, which also regenerates every pixel GIF.
- **R2 invalidation.** When a file is rewritten, its key is dropped from
  `scripts/.r2-upload-manifest.json` so `upload-to-r2.mjs` re-uploads it (the manifest is
  path-based, not content-hashed).

### bilibili wiki pipeline (wiki.biligame.com)

`rarityN/<devName>/wiki_zh.json` + `voice/*.mp3` hold scraped text (basic info, skills, story,
evaluation, voice lines). Two steps: `npm run scrape:wiki-zh` (`scripts/scrape-wiki-zh.mjs`,
shared parsing in `scripts/lib/wiki-common.mjs`) crawls into `scripts/.wiki-scrape-cache/`
(gitignored, resumable); `npm run match:wiki-zh` (`scripts/match-wiki-to-roster.mjs`) matches
pages to `roster.json` by `jpName`, downloads voice mp3s, writes `wiki_zh.json`, and stamps
`hasWiki`/`voiceCount`/`zhName` on the roster (unmatched cases →
`Character Assets/_unmatched_wiki_report.md`). A future English source can follow the same shape,
matched by `enName` into `wiki_en.json`.

### miaowm5 pipeline (worldflipper.miaowm5.com)

miaowm5 is an open-source Svelte SPA (github.com/miaowm5/wf-encyclopedia) serving structured JSON
from public CDNs, keyed by `devName` — the same key `roster.json` uses, so matching is exact.
**No HTML scraping**: `scripts/fetch-miaowm5.mjs` fetches the site's own JSON and decodes it with
ports of the site's parsing logic (`scripts/lib/miaowm5-common.mjs`). When changing a decoder,
check it against the upstream source, not the raw columns.

`npm run fetch:miaowm5` (flags: `--force`, `--limit=N`, `--only=devName,...`, `--new-chars`) is
resumable: HTTP responses cache under `scripts/.miaowm5-cache/` (gitignored), per-character
progress in `scripts/.miaowm5-manifest.json`. Cold full run ~60 min / ~1.2GB cache; a no-op re-run
takes seconds. `Character Assets/_miaowm5_report.md` lists roster characters missing from miaowm5.

**Three ID spaces — the main trap.** `devName` keys the roster/folders and
`character.json`/`pixel.json`; `gameId` keys `character_text`/`character_quest` (what
`encyclopedia[5]` points at); `storyId` (`character.json`'s `[8]`) keys `story_character` and the
pixel atlases. `storyId` usually equals `devName` but not always — never assume. (`head.png`'s
atlas is keyed by `devName`, upstream's own choice, not an inconsistency to "fix".)

**Owned-keys contract.** Inside `wiki_zh.json` the pipeline owns exactly `info`, `related`,
`emotions`, `pixelActions`, `storyCount`, `miaowm5Meta`, `voice[].textJp` — never the
bilibili-owned keys. It merges into the existing file (creating a skeleton with empty bilibili
fields for the ~6 characters bilibili never matched) and deletes keys that come out empty.

**`--new-chars` (roster-producing mode).** Default runs iterate `roster.json`; `--new-chars`
iterates `character.json` to bootstrap unknown characters — creates `rarityN/<devName>/`, runs the
same steps, appends a roster entry (`rarity` = row[2], `attribute` = row[3] via
Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light/Dark). Only adds characters with **both** a pixel timeline and
`story_character` bust art, and skips the `700xxx` `gameId` block (engine-internal stubs/variants).
Idempotent — once in the roster, no longer "new". This yielded 108 characters; roster is 485.

**`bustOnly` characters.** Those 108 have no 1440x1920 full illustration anywhere — only the
570x690 story bust — so they carry `bustOnly: true` and the detail page uses the stacked bust as
hero art with the awaken toggle hidden. They also have **no `enName`/`jpName`** (miaowm5 is a
Chinese source) — only `zhName` from `character_text[gameId][0]`; the front-end falls back
`enName || zhName || devName`. Three Black Clover collab characters have Japanese-script `zhName`s
because the game's own CN data left them untranslated.

**Per-character outputs** (beyond the `wiki_zh.json` keys):

- `story_zh.json` — full dialogue per episode (speaker, name-plate colour, emotion, text). Big, so
  the front-end fetches it only when the story panel opens (`loadStory()`), not in `goDetail()`.
- `emotion/*.png` — expression art as two 570x690 layers (`base_N.png` body + `<i>_<name>.png`
  face) that the front-end stacks.
- `head.png` — 212x212 framed portrait, a port of upstream's `headIcon.svelte` canvas composite
  with its exact offsets: portrait scaled to 184x184 at (14,14) inside `character_face_frame`,
  element badge scaled 61→48 at (154,10) in the frame's notch. Element index is `character.json`
  row[3], `0..5 → red/blue/yellow/green/white/black` — same order as `ATTRIBUTES`. No element →
  `character_face_empty_frame` (un-notched, no badge). Upstream also stamps a rarity strip at
  (0,177); **we deliberately skip it** — the Units grid draws rarity on the pedestal instead.
  The roster carries `hasHead` because partial runs may lack the file; callers fall back to the
  pixel `neutral.gif` rather than trusting the path.
- `story_heads/<devName>.png` + `story_heads.json` manifest (flat `devName → path` map) — the same
  framed portrait for story-only NPCs (Light, Stella, guild staff, bosses) who speak but aren't
  playable (~42 of them). `buildStoryHeads` runs after the per-character loop and scans every
  `story_zh.json` **off disk** for `speakerDev`s, so `--only`/`--limit` never shrinks the manifest.
  NPCs have no `character.json` row → element `-1` → un-notched empty frame. Unlike `icons/`,
  these live under `Character Assets/` and **do** go to R2 (in `upload-to-r2.mjs`'s include lists).
- missing pixel `*.gif` — extra actions beyond the shipped five + `special`
  (`into_coffin`/`ghost_raise`/`ghost_neutral`/`revive`, etc.). **`special` is a special case**:
  its frames live in a second atlas (`pixel_special`) and `pixel.json`'s timeline never references
  them; upstream synthesizes the entry with a 10000 frame-id offset and `buildPixelGifs` mirrors
  that. Characters below 4★ have no special frames — ~92 legitimately lack `special.gif`, that's
  the game's data. `pixelActions` lists what the folder actually holds so the UI never links a
  missing file. **Existing GIFs are left alone** — they came from an older upstream data revision;
  regenerating would change timings for no benefit.
- roster stamps: `race` (an array — can be `["Human","Beast"]`, row[4]) and `gender` (row[7]),
  driving the Units filter only. `gender` stays raw (`Male`/`Female`/`Unknown`/one-off `Ririi`);
  the front-end folds non-Male/Female into `Other`, as upstream does. Three entries with
  `thumb: null` are skipped by every mode and filtered out of the grid.

**`icons/*.png`** — the one output outside `Character Assets/`: shared UI chrome, committed to
git, served with the site, **never touched by the R2 pipeline** (don't call `invalidateR2` on
them; it resolves paths relative to `Character Assets/`). Same delete-before-regenerating rule.

- `rarity_{1..5}.png` — the game's rarity stars, drawn on grid pedestals and beside the detail
  name. Exported **without** upstream's dark background plate (deliberate — it muddied the
  pedestal's attribute colour). Art is a fixed 27px tall but widens with star count (29→128px), so
  the front-end sizes by height and lets width follow. The 5★ cyan accents are the game's art.
- `element_{0..5}.png` / `race_<Race>.png` (`buildFilterIcons`) — filter-chip badges, named by the
  *data* value (row[3] index, row[4] token) so the front-end builds paths straight from roster
  fields. Race chips use the sheet's `_medium2` variants, matching upstream's filter.
- `title_border_{left,right}.png` — section-heading flourishes. Upstream's sprite names are
  `wf_ui_flipper_border_left` and plain `wf_ui_flipper_border` (the right one) — renamed to spare
  the next reader that trap.
- `circle.png` — the magic-circle backdrop, written by `buildMagicCircle`: a standalone file on
  `CDN_A` (`ui/circle.png`), copied byte-for-byte, no atlas decoding.

## Commands

- `npm run upload:assets` — uploads `Character Assets/` to Cloudflare R2 (`wf-assets`) via
  `scripts/upload-to-r2.mjs`. Needs `npx wrangler login` once (or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` /
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`). Ships only `roster.json`, `story_heads.json`, `rarityN/`,
  `story_heads/` (see `INCLUDE_TOP_LEVEL`/`INCLUDE_DIR_PREFIX`); dev-only files are excluded.
  Resumes via `scripts/.r2-upload-manifest.json`; `--force` re-uploads everything.
- No lint/test/build commands exist.

## Architecture

### The `x-dc` template + `DCLogic` component pattern

`index.html` is authored for a small proprietary runtime ("omelette"/`dc-runtime`) whose compiled
output is `support.js` — **do not hand-edit `support.js`** (generated from `dc-runtime/src/*.ts`,
source not in this repo). `image-slot.js` is likewise scaffold for the authoring tool, inert at
runtime — not for feature edits.

- `<x-dc>...</x-dc>` is the view template: HTML/SVG plus `{{ expr }}` interpolation,
  `<sc-if value="{{ cond }}">` conditionals (`hint-placeholder-val` is an editor hint, not logic),
  and `onClick="{{ handler }}"` / `style-hover` / `style-active` bindings.
- The `<script type="text/x-dc" data-dc-script data-props="{...}">` block is real JS: one
  `class Component extends DCLogic` with `state`, `componentDidMount`, handlers, and
  `renderVals()` returning the flat object every `{{ }}` binding reads. **All view logic lives in
  `renderVals()`** — a new template binding means a new key in that object. `data-props`
  (entity-encoded JSON) is design-tool metadata and defines `this.props` defaults.

### Backgrounds: the magic circle

The backdrop is a port of miaowm5's `ui/magicCircle.svelte` — `icons/circle.png` on a 25s linear
spin over flat `#EAEAEA`. It replaced **every** blue surface and every transparency checkerboard
the site used to have; don't bring those back. CSS lives in the `<helmet>` block as `.wf-circle`
plus the `.wf-circle-dialog` variant (smaller, 60% opacity, lower). Three hosts: the card's screen
area (backdrop), the detail drawer, the filter dialog. The two art stages (GIF stage, expression
viewer) deliberately have none and stay flat `#F4F6F9`. If you touch this:

- **`z-index: -1` on `.wf-circle` is load-bearing** (upstream's value): above the host's
  background, behind its in-flow content. Every host needs its own stacking context
  (`position: relative; z-index: 0` or an existing z-index) or the circle vanishes behind the
  host — plus `overflow: hidden` to crop the circle's bottom half.
- **The translate is repeated inside both keyframes** — animating `rotate()` alone drops the
  centering and flings the circle off-screen. The two variants can't share a keyframe (50% vs 60%
  resting translate).
- The backdrop hangs off the screen area, not the card, so the opaque tab bar can't cover it.
- Visibility gaps are inherent: home island art and the detail hero cover it; the drawer's circle
  only surfaces at the expanded snap point.

### Single component, tab-based navigation

One `Component` instance; `state.tab` (`'home' | 'units' | 'story' | 'music' | 'arms' | 'art' |
'detail'`) drives `<sc-if>` visibility — no router. `go(tab)` switches; `this.sections` holds
per-tab metadata.

The **Units** tab fetches `roster.json` once (`componentDidMount`), **sorts** it (rarity desc,
then attribute in `ELEMENT_ORDER` = Fire/Water/Thunder/Wind/Light/Dark, then `devName` — the
file's own order is just append history), and paginates client-side (`ROSTER_BATCH` = 60 per
scroll batch via `handleRosterScroll`). `goDetail(c)` opens the per-character detail view.

#### Units filter

A port of miaowm5's `dialog/filterCharacter.svelte` (round `icons/filer.jpg` button, top-left).
Five groups — name, rarity, element, gender, race — OR within a group, AND across groups, empty
group inert ("nothing picked" = "show everything"). Notes:

- Upstream's rarity-"Other" and element-"Other" NPC chips are deliberately dropped — this roster
  is characters only, they'd match nothing.
- Rarity chips are stars-only (no number label); the label survives as the `img`'s `alt`, which is
  what a screen reader/test should select on (the grid tile uses a different alt format, `5★`).
- Chip `box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)` isn't arbitrary: upstream's chips are `<button>`s
  shadowed by its `reset.css`; ours are `<div>`s, so without it a `#fafafa` chip vanishes into the
  `#fafafa` dialog.
- Four race labels differ from their data key (upstream's own i18n, copied verbatim): `Element`→
  "Elf", `Devil`→"Demon", `Mystery`→"Fairy", `Plants`→"Plant". `FILTER_RACES` values stay the raw
  tokens because that's what `race` holds.
- `state.filter` is applied; `state.draftFilter` is the dialog's working copy (OK commits, Cancel
  discards). `cloneFilter()` copies the group arrays — a shallow spread would let the draft mutate
  the applied filter.
- `filteredRoster()` is the single source for both `renderVals` and `handleRosterScroll`, so
  pagination counts matches. Applying a filter resets `visibleCount`.
- The button (38px circle at 4,66) is wedged into the only free gap between the banner icon
  (ends y=68) and the first tile (starts y=101, portrait from x=38). Moving or growing it collides.

#### Units grid tile

Mimics the game's party screen in an 82x100 box: framed `head.png` on top, pixel `neutral.gif` on
a pedestal built from two CSS shapes (elliptical top face + `clip-path` trapezoid body) tinted by
attribute via `PEDESTAL`, with `icons/rarity_{N}.png` centred on the body. Coupled numbers:

- The sprite's `bottom` puts its feet on the ellipse's centre line — resize the pedestal and the
  offset must move too.
- Stars are sized by height so width follows rarity (33px at 5★). They must fit the trapezoid's
  narrow bottom edge (~37px at the current 52px width / `14%/86%` clip) — 5★ overhangs first.
- Row height (116px) is tuned against the scroller's 622px with ~10px slack; growing the tile
  means shrinking something else.

#### Character detail bottom sheet

The sheet (`SHEET_HEIGHT` = 620px) splits into a fixed top strip (drag handle + name/star row,
carrying `sheetPointerDown` and `touch-action: none`) and a `flex: 1; overflow-y: auto` body —
that split is what keeps native touch scrolling working in the body. Dragging snaps between
`SHEET_EXPANDED_Y`/`MID`/`COLLAPSED`; past the visible height, the body's own scroll reveals
content.

**Panel switcher.** Four round icon buttons float above the sheet's top-right corner as a
*sibling* of the sheet div, sharing `sheetTransform`/`sheetTransition` so they track the drag
without joining its layout. `state.sheetPanel` (via `setSheetPanel()`) picks the body content:

- **profile** — GIF stage, Skill/Special buttons + `extraActionButtons` pills, theme-music pills,
  expression viewer (`hasEmotions`), and wiki text sections gated by `hasWikiInfoRows` /
  `hasWikiSkills` / `hasWikiStory` / `hasWikiReview` (encyclopedia `info` renders under the story
  intro, so `hasWikiStory` accounts for it too).
- **voice** — voice-line list with Japanese `textJp` sub-text; `hasNoVoiceTracks` empty state.
- **story** — episode list → dialogue (`storyIndex` picks `showStoryList` / `showStoryDetail` /
  `showStoryEmpty`). The only lazy-fetching panel (`loadStory()`, once per character, guarded
  against navigating away mid-flight).
- **related** — related-character chips (click → `goDetail` via `rosterByDev`; no roster match
  gets a placeholder tile) and keyword cards.

**Story dialogue avatars** resolve in three tiers: (1) the viewed character speaks in their own
expression art (keyed on exported `emotions[]`); (2) other roster speakers use their `head.png`
via `rosterByDev` — `speakerDev` is a `storyId` but agrees with `devName` for all 485 entries;
(3) story-only NPCs use `story_heads/` via the `this.storyHeads` map from `story_heads.json`
(fetched once in `componentDidMount`, independent of the roster; the front-end trusts the manifest,
never the bare path). Anything left keeps the plain name plate. The avatar box is a rounded square,
not a circle — a circle would clip `head.png`'s corner badge.

**Hero art.** Normally `full_shot_1440_1920_{0,1}.png` with the awaken toggle. `bustOnly`
characters get the stacked 570x690 bust (`showBustHero`, `normal` face) with the toggle hidden
(`showArtToggle`). The bust rides the lazy `wiki_zh.json` fetch, so the hero paints a beat late.

#### Emotion layers (faces vs. overlays)

`story_zh.json`'s `emotion` is a **comma-separated layer stack** (e.g. `"normal,sweat"` — face,
then overlay, over the shared `base_N.png`). ~7% of lines carry an overlay, so resolving `emotion`
as a single name silently loses their art; `resolveEmotionStack()` splits and draws every front in
order. `isEmotionOverlay()` splits `emotions[]` into faces (the prev/next cycler) and overlays
(the "Add-ons" toggle chips, `state.emotionOverlays`). **Classification comes from the game's own
data, not sprite art**: every token seen trailing in any `story_zh.json` is an overlay, sharing
the roots in `EMOTION_OVERLAY_ROOTS`. Traps:

- Sprite size does *not* identify an overlay (`shame` can cover as much canvas as a face).
- The root rule over-reaches: `tear_b`/`tear_c` are whole faces; `EMOTION_FACE_NAMES` pins them
  back. Check trailing-token usage before adding a root.

Overlays are offered only when they share the current face's `base` (mirrored art ships each
twice, e.g. `shame` on base_0 / `shame_right` on base_1); toggles key on the un-mirrored name
(`emotionOverlayKey()`) so flipping faces keeps the accessory on, while distinct variants stay
separate keys.

### UI localization (`STRINGS` table)

UI chrome is bilingual (en/zh), all in the `data-dc-script` block: `STRINGS` is a flat
`{ key: { en, zh } }` table; `state.lang` persists to `localStorage` (`wf_lang`) via
`loadLang()`/`toggleLang()`; `this.t(key)` resolves (falls back to `en`). **No hardcoded
user-facing text remains in the `<x-dc>` template** — new UI copy means a `STRINGS` entry + a
`renderVals()` binding. `this.sections` is a getter so it re-resolves through `t()` per render.
Character *content* stays outside the table; the one exception is the display name (`zhName` over
`enName` when `state.lang === 'zh'`). Future per-language content fields should follow the flat
suffix convention (`enName`/`jpName`/`zhName`), not nesting.

### Asset loading: local vs. R2

`ASSET_BASE` switches on how the page is served: `file://`/`localhost` → local
`Character Assets/`; anything else → the public Cloudflare R2 bucket. **Check both branches when
changing asset references.** `Character Assets/`, `WF OST/`, and `node_modules/` are gitignored;
only `roster.json`, `story_heads.json`, `rarityN/*`, and `story_heads/*` reach R2 — any new asset
type must be added to `upload-to-r2.mjs`'s include rules or it silently never ships.

`roster.json` entries carry `devName`, `enName`, `jpName`, `rarity`, `attribute`, `thumb`,
optional `music` (mp3 filenames, ~150 characters), `hasHead` (the `head.png` URL is derived from
`thumb`'s path, not stored), `race`/`gender`, and — for wiki-matched characters —
`zhName`/`hasWiki`/`voiceCount`; `--new-chars` entries carry `bustOnly: true` instead (see above).
Per-character folders (`rarityN/<devName>/`) hold the GIFs/art, optional `music/`, and the
pipeline outputs (`wiki_zh.json`, `voice/`, `story_zh.json`, `emotion/`). Music plays through one
persistent `this.audio = new Audio()` (`toggleMusicTrack`/`stopMusic`), rendered as pill buttons
when `music.length > 0`.

### Visit counters (top status bar)

The two top-right pills (`icons/Mana.png` = total page views, `icons/Lodestar_Bead.png` = unique
visitors) are backed by Supabase. `recordVisit()` (called once in `componentDidMount`) POSTs to one
RPC, `record_visit(vid)`, which bumps a PV counter, upserts the visitor id, and returns `{pv, uv}`;
`renderVals` formats them into `pvCount`/`uvCount` (a dash until it resolves). `vid` is a random
uuid persisted in `localStorage` (`wf_visitor_id`), so reloads dedupe to one unique visitor — **no
IP is ever read** (a browser can't, and it'd miscount shared/rotating IPs anyway). Config lives in
`SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` next to `ASSET_BASE`; the anon key is safe to ship because the
SQL (`supabase-visit-counter.sql`) grants the anon role EXECUTE on only that SECURITY DEFINER
function and leaves both tables behind RLS with no policies. **`recordVisit()` no-ops on
`file://`/`localhost`** (so dev reloads don't inflate the live totals) and while `SUPABASE_URL`
still holds its `YOUR_PROJECT` placeholder. This is unrelated to R2 — the counters never touch
`Character Assets/` or the upload pipeline.
